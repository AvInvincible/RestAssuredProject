1. REST - REST is a Representation State Transfer. It is a set of constraints
Constraints are - 
- Client â€“ Server Architecture style : Application could be modeled like a client-server arch. The UI
components should be separate from the backend 

- Stateless - This constraint state that the server should not store the client context. Each of the 
request should be treated as a unique.

- Cache - This state that whether we the response from server should be cached by the client. For the caching response 
the response are taken from the cache instead from the server. Which save the bandwidth.

- Uniform interface
- Layered System - This constraint state that the system should be layered
- Code on demand - Downloadable code
